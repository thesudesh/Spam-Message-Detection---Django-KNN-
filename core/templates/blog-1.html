        <h2>How is Spam Detected?</h2>
        <p>Spam detection relies on various techniques and technologies to filter out unwanted emails. Here are some common methods:</p>
        <ul class="tips-list">
            <li class="tip-item">Content filtering: This method analyzes the content of emails for known spam keywords, phrases, or patterns. Emails containing such content are flagged as spam.</li>
            <li class="tip-item">Sender reputation: Email servers maintain a database of sender reputations based on past behavior. Senders with a history of sending spam or suspicious emails are more likely to have their messages marked as spam.</li>
            <li class="tip-item">Blacklists and whitelists: Blacklists contain known spam senders or domains, while whitelists include trusted senders. Emails from blacklisted sources are often blocked or flagged as spam, while whitelisted sources bypass spam filters.</li>
            <li class="tip-item">Machine learning algorithms: Advanced spam detection systems use machine learning to analyze email attributes and behavior patterns to identify spam accurately.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Preventive Measures Against Spam</h2>
        <p>While spam filters are effective, taking proactive steps can further reduce the likelihood of receiving spam emails:</p>
        <ul class="tips-list">
            <li class="tip-item">Use a strong spam filter: Enable and regularly update your email provider's spam filter settings to catch and divert spam emails away from your inbox.</li>
            <li class="tip-item">Be cautious with email addresses: Avoid sharing your email address publicly or on untrusted websites to prevent it from being harvested by spammers.</li>
            <li class="tip-item">Use disposable email addresses: Consider using temporary or disposable email addresses for online registrations or services that may result in spam.</li>
            <li class="tip-item">Do not click on suspicious links or attachments: Be wary of emails from unknown senders or emails that ask for personal information. Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from such emails.</li>
            <li class="tip-item">Keep your software updated: Ensure that your email client, web browser, and operating system are up-to-date with the latest security patches to protect against spam and other cyber threats.</li>
            <li class="tip-item">Educate yourself and others: Stay informed about common spam tactics and educate friends and family about how to recognize and avoid spam emails.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Spam emails can be a nuisance and a potential security risk. By understanding how spam is detected and implementing preventive measures, you can significantly reduce the impact of spam on your online activities. Remember to stay vigilant, use technology tools wisely, and educate yourself to stay safe in the digital world.</p>
